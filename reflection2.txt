Frosh Solidarity Night

The Frosh Solidarity Night was also a success like the Frosh Orientation Program. At first I was somewhat curious about it
because they told us that it was for us frosh; A sort of welcome party for us froshies. It was true enough that night
was fun filled party and at the first part of the program. Some students from higher batches presented some play, it was
a play which was presented in an artistic and fun way, the play was all about the life in St. Benilde; How we will
survive in St. Benilde and also some rules and regulations was also tackled during the play. After the play, the PEP Squad
presented their cheer to us. They encourage us to interact with them as they do the cheer. They taught us all the cheers
that we will be using if ever we have sport game plays. After that, the real party started. There was a DJ and was playing
music until the end of the event. Though I was alone that night, I had fun because I saw some of my schoolmates and I had
fun watching higher batches of St. Benilde enjoying that night and they were like crazy. I'm alone because I didn't 
interact with some of my blockmates during frosh orientation program and my schoolmates had their accompaniment by their
friends from their previous school and I don't want to annoy them and in my side I don't want to be Out of Place. So, I
better decide to be alone. Then, when I felt so bored with my place I stand and walk along the back part of the venue to
search for some food to eat and I saw NYFD and shakeys? and there were lots of students buying foods. So, I decided to wait
until the end of the event because my dad was waiting for me outside and maybe after the event we would eat outside. though
he gave me money for me to eat inside; I decided to kept the money. Then I was wrong, after the event I went to my dad's 
car at the parking lot and we went home. On our way home, I felt asleep while I was on the car because I was so tired.
