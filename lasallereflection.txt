St. John Baptist De La Salle (Quote - Reflection)

“You act as mediator in regard to your students, God making use of you to teach them the means of salvation.” MSF 56.3

	St. John Baptist De La Salle was a teacher to young children which he spend his own money for these kids. He helped 
them in his own simple way. Thus, he built schools for those children. 

	This quote means that teachers who acts as mediator in their students, teachers; they are somewhat the descendants of 
god here on earth. Why they are descendants? Because they educate students to learn about God and all the things that 
surrounds them and also they help our world because those students that they’ve taught might be our future leaders of 
our country. They educate students not to be ignorant in their environment and help them to be productive citizens. 
Also, those teachers briefly educate students about god and the salvation. It’s a good thing that we have teacher now 
a days for us to learn new things, new discoveries, new information, etc. We, students in return must respect their 
teachers because without them we would be ignorant. God always make move for us to feel his loving presence by means 
of teachers.

	St. John Baptist De La Salle was devoted in what he was doing, that’s why he became saint. He serves as inspiration 
for us that we must be dedicated in what we are doing. We must put our best effort in everything that we do. We must 
keep in our minds that god must be the center of our decisions in life.
