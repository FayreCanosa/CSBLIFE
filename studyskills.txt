1. Have you every failed an exam? What were the reasons for failing?
   Yes, in one of my quiz in history but not that so badly failed because i need one point for me to pass that exam. I didn't
review for it. I didn't take down too much notes during discussion.

*for thoes who haven't failed in aexam. What was your highest score in exam? What do you think made you reach the top?
   I'm lazy to review and just spend time facebooking.

2. How was your first experience of CSB Midterm Examination? knowing what you know now, what would have you done differently? 
What are you going to do again for the CSB Finals?
   It was fine, it's just a normal examination for me but it's kinda long unlike in high school. I read a history book which is very un-interesting for me. I will
study more because i want to get high grades.
